Ideas:

More enemy types: 
[ ]	Seeker (blue) - will follow player until they collide. If collides, player gets (â€¦). 
		Must run away from him to get rid of him
[ ] 	Assassin - comes from behind. Will Follow you until he gives up
[X]	Jumper  (brownish) - will jump when directly below the player
	
Enemy collision - should enemies merge when they collide with the same type?
	Evolve - becomes something new
	Improve - becomes bigger, faster and collisions make a bigger impact
	Explode - more mini versions appear of it

Random generation:
[ ]	should enemies appear from everywhere (not just the right side?)
[X]	should they appear at random intervals?
		more detailed randomization
	
Player upgrades:
	spare lives
	resistance to mobs
	multi-jump
	fly?
	
Traps: 
	spikes
	lava pit
	laser beams
	rockets
	
Platforms???
