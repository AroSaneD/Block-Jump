	Steps:
		1. Need to measure travelled distance{
			on each update call{
				1. Mark the current coordinates
				2. Subtract current coordinates from previous
				3. Add difference to ruler
			}
			when scree shifts, add the difference to the ruler
		}
		2. Invent special formula to calculate gained currency (more travelled = more gained ^ 1.5)
		3. Make the view controller hold the money (since it's global, later make minions save it in memory)

	Generate objects in accordance to the screen (so the mob is ~10% of the screen)
	Is is possible to scale images?
